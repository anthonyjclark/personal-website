Compared with legged or flying robots, however, wheeled robots struggle with uneven terrain and simple, medium-sized obstacles (i.e., obstacles roughly the size of their wheels). Legged locomotion solves this challenge by stepping or climbing over obstacles, but suffers from power consumption, poor stability, and control complexity. Hybrid wheel/leg robots transform their locomotion systems between wheeled and legged modes to maximize the performance benefits of each locomotion mode. We present our design of a novel hybrid wheel/leg robot that uses a geared coaxial shaft mechanism to transform between states of wheeled and legged-wheel locomotion. The mechanism is also able to operate at intermediate states between these two modes. We present our mechanical design, development of a basic control policy, and preliminary experiments demonstrating basic capabilities of the robot. We show that the robot is able to navigate flat terrain in the wheeled locomotion mode, and can make use of hybrid legged locomotion modes to navigate rough terrain and obstacles. In the future, we plan to iterate on the mechanism’s design, develop and evaluate more advanced control policies that leverage the mechanism’s intermediate locomotion modes, and evaluate the mechanism’s performance in real-world environments.</span>

In evolutionary robotics applications, the focus is often on maximizing performance of an animat for a specific task. Analyzing evolved behaviors can be challenging, however, given the complex coupling of morphology and brain. In this paper, we introduce a simulation environment built to investigate animats capable of smoothly transitioning between operating modes (e.g., from cautious to aggressive or from one physical form to another). The simulator provides functionality for logging sensory information as well as animat state enabling a deep analysis. Although more abstract than soft-body or rigid-body physics engines, it is lightweight and efficient, allowing for a high number of simulations in a small amount of time. The simulation supplements other more complex physics-based environments providing for greater inspection of sensor information and animat behavior. Furthermore, it is designed to provide an extensible test bed beyond just gait transitions to assess new artificial intelligence and evolutionary algorithms and more importantly the combination of these techniques.</span>

In this study, we investigate and compare several different inputs formats for improving terrain classification using a CNN.

Our experiments lead us to the following: (1) input formats should prefer grayscale over color images as color has a tendency to overfit the training data, and (2) disparity maps also improve classification compared with raw image data.

By incorporating flexibility, they reduce ground impact forces and improve locomotive efficiency. Flexibility is also beneficial for robotic systems, although it remains challenging to implement. In this paper, we explore the addition of passive flexibility to a quadrupedal animat; we measure the impact of flexibility on both locomotive performance and energy efficiency of movement. Results show that spine and lower limb flexibility can significantly increase distance traveled when compared to an animat with no flexibility. However, replacing passively flexibile joints with actively controlled joints evolves more effective individuals with similar efficiency. Given these results, the number of joints and joint configuration appear to drive performance increases rather than just the addition of passive flexibility.</span>

In this study, we evolve controllers and physical characteristics of a UGV with transformable wheels to improve its mobility in a simulated environment. The UGV’s mission is to visit a sequence of coordinates while automatically handling obstacles of varying sizes by extending wheel struts radially outward from the center of each wheel. Evolved finite state machines (FSMs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) are compared, and a set of controller design principles are gathered from analyzing these experiments.

The digital muscle model (DMM) emulates the low-level musculoskeletal system and can be combined with a high-level artificial neural network (ANN) controller forming a hybrid control strategy. Previous work has shown that, compared to ANN-only controllers, hybrid ANN/DMM controllers exhibit similar performance with fewer synapses, suggesting that some computation is offloaded to the low-level DMM. An open question is how the complexity of the robot, in terms of the number of joints, affects the evolution of the ANN control structure. We explore this question by evolving both hybrid controllers and ANN-only controllers for worm-like animats of varying complexity. Specifically, the number of joints in the worms ranges from 1 to 12. Consistent with an earlier study, the results demonstrate that, in most cases, hybrid ANN/DMM controllers exhibit equal or better performance than ANN-only controllers. In addition, above a threshold for animat complexity (number of joints), the ANNs for one variant of the hybrid controllers have significantly fewer connections than the ANN-only controllers.</span>

Evolved behaviors exhibit a variety of unexpected, complex fin/flipper movements that enable the robot to achieve and maintain station, despite water flow from different directions.

In this paper, we present an evolutionary computation approach for designing the caudal fin of a carangiform robotic fish. Evolutionary experiments are performed in a simulated environment utilizing a mathematical model to approximate the hydrodynamic motion of a flexible caudal fin. With this model, time-consuming computational fluid dynamic simulations can be avoided while maintaining a physically realistic simulation. Two approaches are employed to maximize a robotic fish’s average velocity. First, a hill-climbing algorithm is applied to find the optimal stiffness for a fixed shape caudal fin. Next, both fin stiffness and shape are simultaneously optimized with a genetic algorithm. Additionally, simulated caudal fins are compared to physically validated fins, which were fabricated with the aid of a 3D printer and tested on a robotic fish prototype. Results show a correlation between evolved results, model predicted behavior, and physical robot performance with some disparity due to the difficulty in accurately approximating real world performance in a simulation environment. Despite the disparity, evolutionary design is shown to be a viable process.</span>

Evolve-a-Robot does this by visualizing the evolution of robotic cars with an easy-to-use interface. And second, to expose enough of the adjustable parameters (i.e. genetic operators, and evolutionary configuration) to make the simulation useful for teaching evolutionary algorithms to undergraduate students. <a href="https://github.com/evolve-a-robot/evolve-a-robot.github.io">Code</a>, <a href="/static/pdf/Moore.2014.ALIFE.EvolutionaryRoboticsWeb.pdf">Description</a></p></div>
