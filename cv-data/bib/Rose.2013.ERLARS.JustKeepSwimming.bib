  abstract   = "A robust robotic system should be able to overcome unforeseen conditions, including physical damage and component failure occurring after deployment. A self-modeling system maintains an internal image of itself, which can be updated to reflect incurred damage. The robot can use this model to derive (or evolve) new behaviors such as gaits that account for the damage. In this paper we describe an approach to self-modeling for aquatic robots. The aquatic environment presents unique challenges to the self-modeling process, including the inherent uncertainty in the robotâ€™s orientation and configuration. We propose and evaluate two approaches to automatically infer missing contextual information, which otherwise complicates the task of developing an accurate model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods on a particular aquatic robot intended for remote sensing.",
