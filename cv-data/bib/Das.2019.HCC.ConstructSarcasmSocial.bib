  abstract   = "The basic idea behind machine learning-based systems, or artificial intelligence in general, is mimicking how humans operate. This idea is particularly true for our problem, sarcasm detection on social networking sites (SNSs). Therefore, before proceeding to build a system that can detect sarcasm on SNSs, we attempt to understand how humans do the same. Many studies propose approaches based on personal experience and word-level definition of \"sarcasm\". However, in this paper, we aim to find more general themes that are typical with users while detecting and expressing sarcasm on SNSs through a qualitative study to build a more effective sarcasm detection model.",
