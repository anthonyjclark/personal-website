  abstract   = " Wheeled locomotion is a power-efficient, generally safer, and easy to control form of robot locomotion. Compared with legged or flying robots, however, wheeled robots struggle with uneven terrain and simple, medium-sized obstacles (i.e., obstacles roughly the size of their wheels). Legged locomotion solves this challenge by stepping or climbing over obstacles, but suffers from power consumption, poor stability, and control complexity. Hybrid wheel/leg robots transform their locomotion systems between wheeled and legged modes to maximize the performance benefits of each locomotion mode. We present our design of a novel hybrid wheel/leg robot that uses a geared coaxial shaft mechanism to transform between states of wheeled and legged-wheel locomotion. The mechanism is also able to operate at intermediate states between these two modes. We present our mechanical design, development of a basic control policy, and preliminary experiments demonstrating basic capabilities of the robot. We show that the robot is able to navigate flat terrain in the wheeled locomotion mode, and can make use of hybrid legged locomotion modes to navigate rough terrain and obstacles. In the future, we plan to iterate on the mechanism's design, develop and evaluate more advanced control policies that leverage the mechanism's intermediate locomotion modes, and evaluate the mechanism's performance in real-world environments.",
