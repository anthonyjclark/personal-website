  abstract   = {In this paper, we present a strategy to evolve neurocontrollers in aquatic robots capable of generalized station keeping, that is, maintaining a position in the presence of various water flows. Evolved behaviors exhibit a variety of complex fin/flipper movements that enable the robot to react and move against changing flows. Moreover, results indicate that some sensor modalities are beneficial when the robot is placed in novel environments, though little used during the evolutionary process.},
