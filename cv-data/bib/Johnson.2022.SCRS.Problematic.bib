  abstract   = "Many robot use-cases put a robot in close contact with people. These scenarios require the robot to make complex decisions that---above all else---must be safe. Often, sensor processing and decision making methods rely heavily on machine learning, and these techniques are only as useful as the training dataset. Current methods and datasets do not account for enough variation or extraordinary conditions. We propose using novelty search to discover scenarios causing a model to behave poorly.",
