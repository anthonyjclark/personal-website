    "abstract": "Designing a robotic fish is a challenging endeavor due to the non-linear dynamics of underwater environments. In this paper, we present an evolutionary computation approach for designing the caudal fin of a carangiform robotic fish. Evolutionary experiments are performed in a simulated environment utilizing a mathematical model to approximate the hydrodynamic motion of a flexible caudal fin. With this model, time-consuming computational fluid dynamic simulations can be avoided while maintaining a physically realistic simulation. Two approaches are employed to maximize a robotic fish’s average velocity. First, a hill-climbing algorithm is applied to find the optimal stiffness for a fixed shape caudal fin. Next, both fin stiffness and shape are simultaneously optimized with a genetic algorithm. Additionally, simulated caudal fins are compared to physically validated fins, which were fabricated with the aid of a 3D printer and tested on a robotic fish prototype. Results show a correlation between evolved results, model predicted behavior, and physical robot performance with some disparity due to the difficulty in accurately approximating real world performance in a simulation environment. Despite the disparity, evolutionary design is shown to be a viable process.",

    "abstract": "Robotic fish accomplish swimming by deforming their bodies or other fin-like appendages. As an emerging class of embedded computing system, robotic fish are anticipated to play an important role in environmental monitoring, inspection of underwater structures, tracking of hazardous wastes and oil spills, and the study of live fish behaviors. While integration of flexible materials (into the fins and/or body) holds the promise of improved swimming performance (in terms of both speed and maneuverability) for these robots, such components also introduce significant design challenges due to the complex material mechanics and hydrodynamic interactions. The problem is further exacerbated by the need for the robots to meet multiple objectives (e.g., both speed and energy efficiency). In this paper, we propose an evolutionary multiobjective optimization approach to the design and control of a robotic fish with a flexible caudal fin. Specifically, we use the NSGA-II algorithm to investigate morphological and control parameter values that optimize swimming speed and power usage. Several evolved fin designs are validated experimentally with a small robotic fish, where fins of different stiffness values and sizes are printed with a multi-material 3D printer. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed design approach in balancing the two competing objectives.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive controllers enable cyberphysical systems, such as autonomous robots, to manage uncertain conditions during execution. However, there is a limit to the range of conditions that can be handled by a given controller. When this limit is exceeded, a controller might fail to respond as expected, not only rendering it ineffective but possibly putting the entire system at risk. In this paper, we describe a method based on evolutionary search for automatically enhancing, and discovering the boundaries of, a given adaptive controller. Collectively, these boundaries define an execution mode for that controller. Explicit specification of mode boundaries facilitates the development of decision logic that determines, based on system state and sensed conditions, when to switch to a different execution mode and typically a different controller, such as one for providing fail-safe operation. To evaluate the proposed approach, we apply it to a robotic fish propelled by a flexible caudal fin that is governed by a model-free adaptive controller. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach is effective in characterizing a controller’s ability to adapt to environmental dynamics, including physical damage to the robot itself.",

The UGV’s mission is to visit a sequence of coordinates while automatically handling obstacles of varying sizes by extending wheel struts radially outward from the center of each wheel. Evolved finite state machines (FSMs) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) are compared, and a set of controller design principles are gathered from analyzing these experiments.

In this study, we investigate and compare several different inputs formats for improving terrain classification using a CNN. All experiments take place in simulation, where we have complete control over terrain (e.g., shapes and textures) and information about our robot. Our experiments lead us to the following: (1) input formats should prefer grayscale over color images as color has a tendency to overfit the training data, and (2) disparity maps also improve classification compared with raw image data. These results can be used to improve the performance of terrain classification; particularly as they apply to transformable-wheel robots.",

    "abstract": "Sarcasm is a common feature of user interaction on social networking sites. Sarcasm differs with typical communication in alignment of literal meaning with intended meaning. Humans can recognize sarcasm from sufficient context information including from the various contents available on SNS. Existing literature mainly uses text data to detect sarcasm; though, a few recent studies propose to use image data. To date, no study has focused on user interaction pattern as a source of context information for detecting sarcasm. In this paper, we present a supervised machine learning based approach focusing on both contents of posts (e.g., text, image) and users’ interaction on those posts on Facebook.",

    "abstract": "The basic idea behind machine learning-based systems, or artificial intelligence in general, is mimicking how humans operate. This idea is particularly true for our problem, sarcasm detection on social networking sites (SNSs). Therefore, before proceeding to build a system that can detect sarcasm on SNSs, we attempt to understand how humans do the same. Many studies propose approaches based on personal experience and word-level definition of \"sarcasm\". However, in this paper, we aim to find more general themes that are typical with users while detecting and expressing sarcasm on SNSs through a qualitative study to build a more effective sarcasm detection model.",

    "abstract": "In recent times, \"fake news\" has become an increasingly important concept. Primarily, because information is now able to more quickly and deeply propagate among users due to the pervasive nature of the Internet and digital media. That is why it has recently received a large amount of attention from computer science researchers. A large number of studies demonstrate different methods for detecting misinformation in contents shared on the Internet. On the other hand, satire and irony as a part of usual human communication have received less attention. Whereas fake news means misinformation meant to deceive people, satire is misinformation meant to entertain or criticize. Thus, despite both satire and fake news being misinformation these two concepts have different objectives and impacts. Currently, only a few studies have focused on differentiating between satire and fake news. In this paper, we present the limitations of existing works for classifying satire and fake news; discuss the feasibility of using a subjective concept like storytelling as a way to classify satire and fake news; and present a supervised learning approach to classify satire and fake news.",

    "abstract": "Sarcasm is a usual part of human communication that has long been ignored by sentiment analysis researchers. Sarcasm is also an important aspect in entertainment industry for TV series, movies etc. to gain popularity. Very recently, some works have showed the applicability of multimodality (e.g., image, text) in sarcasm research from a sentiment analysis perspective instead of only text-based approaches. However, none of those harnesses video data. We argue videos can be interesting to study to understand nature of sarcasm on social media. We are interested to study how sarcastic videos gain individual’s attention and popularity at large. As an application of this, we showed how an AI agent can suggest about possible areas to gain viewers’ attention in a directed sarcastic video. Identification of both attention gaining areas (AGA) and objects contained in sarcastic videos can be compared with the AGAs and objects in previously successful/popular sarcastic videos. Such AI agent can help inexperienced directors in entertainment industry as a guide and experienced ones to study the changes brought over time in this regard. In this paper, we present two AI agents to identify the optimal AGAs and one empirical study of objects commonly shown in directed sarcastic video settings.",

    "abstract": "Developing complex behaviors for aquatic robots is a difficult engineering challenge due to the uncertainty of an underwater environment. Neuroevolution provides one method of dealing with this type of problem. Artificial neural networks discern different conditions by mapping sensory input to responses, and evolutionary computation provides a training algorithm suitable to the high dimensionality of the problem. In this paper, we present results of applying neuroevolution to an aquatic robot tasked with station keeping, that is, maintaining a given position despite surrounding water flow. The virtual device exposed to evolution is modeled after a physical counterpart that has been fabricated with a 3D printer and tested in physical environments. Evolved behaviors exhibit a variety of unexpected, complex fin/flipper movements that enable the robot to achieve and maintain station, despite water flow from different directions. Moreover, the results show that evolved controllers are able to effectively carry out this task using only information from a simulated accelerometer and gyroscope, matching the inertial measurement unit (IMU) on the actual robot.",

    "abstract": "Web-based applications are highly accessible to users, providing rich, interactive content while eliminating the need to install software locally. However, evolutionary robotics (ER) has faced challenges in this domain as web-based technologies have not been amenable to 3D physics simulations. Traditionally, physics-based simulations require a local installation and a high degree of user knowledge to configure an environment, but the emergence of Javascript-based physics engines enables complex simulations to be executed in web browsers. These developments create opportunities for ER research to reach new audiences by increasing accessibility. In this work, we introduce two web-based tools we have built to facilitate the exchange of ideas with other researchers as well as outreach to K-12 students and the general public. The first tool is intended to distribute and exchange ER research results, while the second is a completely browser-based implementation of an ER environment.",

    "abstract": "Animal movements are realized by a combination of high-level control from the nervous system and joint-level movement provided by the musculoskeletal system. The digital muscle model (DMM) emulates the low-level musculoskeletal system and can be combined with a high-level artificial neural network (ANN) controller forming a hybrid control strategy. Previous work has shown that, compared to ANN-only controllers, hybrid ANN/DMM controllers exhibit similar performance with fewer synapses, suggesting that some computation is offloaded to the low-level DMM. An open question is how the complexity of the robot, in terms of the number of joints, affects the evolution of the ANN control structure. We explore this question by evolving both hybrid controllers and ANN-only controllers for worm-like animats of varying complexity. Specifically, the number of joints in the worms ranges from 1 to 12. Consistent with an earlier study, the results demonstrate that, in most cases, hybrid ANN/DMM controllers exhibit equal or better performance than ANN-only controllers. In addition, above a threshold for animat complexity (number of joints), the ANNs for one variant of the hybrid controllers have significantly fewer connections than the ANN-only controllers.",

Traditional rigid body robots remain the commercially viable option, but incorporating flexibility can harness the benefits exhibited by natural organisms. In this paper, we examine how the addition of passive flexibility impacts performance and locomotive efficiency in a quadruped animat. Results show that the addition of flexibility in the spine and lower limbs of a quadruped animat significantly increases the distance traveled compared to a fully rigid-body animat. However, replacing these passively flexibile joints with actively controlled joints results in the farthest traveling individuals while maintaining similar efficiency. It appears that increases in DOF and joint configuration are the drivers of performance increases rather than passive flexibility.",
