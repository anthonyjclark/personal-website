  abstract   = "Pathfinding in dynamic, indoor environments is fundamental to the reliable, safe, and real-time navigation of autonomous systems. In this study, we present our research generating datasets and comparing deep learning architectures for real-time pathfinding in indoor environments. We use simulation for data collection, compare six architectures, and analyze real-time inference performance on an NVIDIA JetBot. Our work showcases an end-to-end pathfinding approach and highlights challenges to address in future research.",
