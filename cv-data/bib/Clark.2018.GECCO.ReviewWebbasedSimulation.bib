  abstract   = {Evolutionary robotics researchers often need to share results that may be too difficult to describe in text and too complex to show using images. Many researchers include links to videos as supplementary materials, but videos have a predefined view of the scene and do not allow watchers to adjust the viewing angle to their preference. In this paper we present a web-based application (based on three.js) for sharing interactive animations. Specifically, our tool (called Review) enables researchers to generate simple animation log data that can be loaded in any modern web browser on a computer or mobile device. The camera in these animations is controlled by the user such that they can pan, tilt, rotate, and zoom in and out of the scene. Review is meant to improve the ability of researchers to share their evolved results with one another.},
