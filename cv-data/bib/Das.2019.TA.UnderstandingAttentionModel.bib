  abstract   = {Sarcasm is a usual part of human communication that has long been ignored by sentiment analysis researchers. Sarcasm is also an important aspect in entertainment industry for TV series, movies etc. to gain popularity. Very recently, some works have showed the applicability of multimodality (e.g., image, text) in sarcasm research from a sentiment analysis perspective instead of only text-based approaches. However, none of those harnesses video data. We argue videos can be interesting to study to understand nature of sarcasm on social media. We are interested to study how sarcastic videos gain individual's attention and popularity at large. As an application of this, we showed how an AI agent can suggest about possible areas to gain viewers' attention in a directed sarcastic video. Identification of both attention gaining areas (AGA) and objects contained in sarcastic videos can be compared with the AGAs and objects in previously successful/popular sarcastic videos. Such AI agent can help inexperienced directors in entertainment industry as a guide and experienced ones to study the changes brought over time in this regard. In this paper, we present two AI agents to identify the optimal AGAs and one empirical study of objects commonly shown in directed sarcastic video settings.},
