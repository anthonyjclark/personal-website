  abstract   = "Simulation is a vital component for many machine learning-based systems. In this abstract, we present our work using Unreal Engine 5 to create realistic environments for training a neural network used in the navigation system of a mobile robot. We explore the use of randomized textures to create dynamic environments, and we evaluate trained models in environments with both randomly changing and static textures.",
