  abstract   = "Developing complex behaviors for aquatic robots is a difficult engineering challenge due to the uncertainty of an underwater environment. Neuroevolution provides one method of dealing with this type of problem. Artificial neural networks discern different conditions by mapping sensory input to responses, and evolutionary computation provides a training algorithm suitable to the high dimensionality of the problem. In this paper, we present results of applying neuroevolution to an aquatic robot tasked with station keeping, that is, maintaining a given position despite surrounding water flow. The virtual device exposed to evolution is modeled after a physical counterpart that has been fabricated with a 3D printer and tested in physical environments. Evolved behaviors exhibit a variety of unexpected, complex fin/flipper movements that enable the robot to achieve and maintain station, despite water flow from different directions. Moreover, the results show that evolved controllers are able to effectively carry out this task using only information from a simulated accelerometer and gyroscope, matching the inertial measurement unit (IMU) on the actual robot.",
