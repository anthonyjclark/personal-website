  abstract   = {Sarcasm is an important aspect of human communication. However, it is often difficult to detect or understand this sentiment because the literal meaning conveyed in communication is opposite of the intended meaning. Though the field of sentiment analysis is well studied, sarcasm has often been ignored by the research community. So far, to detect sarcasm on social media, studies have largely focused upon textual features. However, visual cues are an important part of sarcasm. In this paper, we present a convolutional neural network based model for detecting sarcasm based on images shared on a popular social photo sharing site, Flickr.},
