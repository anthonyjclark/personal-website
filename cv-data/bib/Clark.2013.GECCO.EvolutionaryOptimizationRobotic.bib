  abstract   = {The nonlinear dynamics of an aquatic environment make robotic fish behavior difficult to predict and subsequently difficult to optimize. In this paper, we present a method for optimizing robotic fish propulsion through the evolution of control patterns and caudal fin flexibility. Evolved solutions are evaluated in a physics-based simulation environment. Control signals are generated with both simple sinusoids and neural oscillators. This study demonstrates how evolutionary algorithms can be utilized to handle the complex interactions among material properties, physical form, and control patterns in an aquatic environment.},
