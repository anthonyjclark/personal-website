details = """
Description: [Evolve-a-Robot](http://evolve-a-robot.github.io/) is an interactive evolutionary robotics simulation. The project has two goals. The first is to expose K-12 students to evolution and evolutionary computation using an engaging and fun platform. Evolve-a-Robot does this by visualizing the evolution of robotic cars with an easy-to-use interface. And second, to expose enough of the adjustable parameters (i.e. genetic operators, and evolutionary configuration) to make the simulation useful for teaching evolutionary algorithms to undergraduate students.

# URL: http://adamwbrown.net/projects-2/biolume/
# Description: The Biolume art exhibit is meant to captivate and inform the general public. The installation will comprise approximately 150 culptural robots that 'evolve' to better interact with patrons. Through interaction with the public, Biolume robots gain energy and are preferentially selected for reproduction to 'replace' less fit neighbors."""
